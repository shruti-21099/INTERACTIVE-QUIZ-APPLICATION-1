**DESCRIPTION**
In the task 1 of interactive quiz application as required made the quiz with four multiple options to the question. here we used the hTML,CSS,javascript to implement it.Basic structure is given by HTML framework is done by the CSS.as the colours and sizes are defined . In javascript the dynamic render is set with question and answer to it.option is checked wheter selected or not if not then warn ,if selected
then next atlast the score will be visisble out of the all question .a typical  quiz app is made up of three main layers as frontend design(HTML,CSS):

structure of HTML:

we use HTML to create the layout of the quiz,add a question section ,answer buttons,and score display of the quiz.differnt types of tags are used like <div>,header tags, section tags .
also lists are given like unordered lists .it gives the basic structue to the app. as it also organizes the data like questions answers . as basic it is the foundation of creating the quiz app by organizing content and providing elements for user.

structure of CSS:

use of css is to make quiz look better. here u can design give respective colors to it. you can design colorful buttons,fonts and the backgrounds.for smooth effectivenes .allow quiz interface to adjust for differnt sizes of tables boxes etc. specific themes are selected .therefore we can say that CSS is used here to to ensure the smoothness, engaging user experience.

Functionality with javascript:

use of javascript is to handle the logic display the one question at the time.move to next question.and keep track of the score . we have to create the list of question we have to ask in quiz with there multiple -choice answers in javascript.each question should have a correct answer.as we have given the few questons for it we can also add many more to it as per requirement.it should be intractive and used to detect when the user selects an answer and provide the score at end . showing the users score and after we can also restart the quiz this is great app to learn function.  it is user handling interactions as we.select an answer it navigate to the next question ,or restart the quiz. it keeps track on the question . conditionals for checking the answers and controlling the quiz flow.

for implementing the quiz application i have used the resourses  while performing are google , chatgpt and the youtube to ellaborate it.
